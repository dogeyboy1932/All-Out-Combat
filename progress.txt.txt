super cool stuff I worked on:

Character:
	- He can stand, walk, run, and jump.
	- stand, walk, and run are animated but jump is not
	- move with WASD, run using shift + W, jump with space (obviously)
	- Jumping is still a bit weird, the players velocity does not really change when in the air.
	  which is realistic but make for an annoying playing experience.
UI:
	- I created most of the health system. There is a health bat and text which does change when you take damage.
	- You can test the health/damage by pressing M (will remove later)
	- I created the score UI as well. Can test this by pressing N (will remove later)
	- There is also a death screen if the players health falls below 0.
	- I also added a start menu screen (when the game first loads)
	- And a menu screen (between games where you can buy new weapons and etc.) that is rudimentary/has nothing basically

TODO:
	- still need UI/system for coins (this will be basically identical to the logic for the score)
	- Some kind of basic enemy would be great for testing health, score, and coins.
	- weapons animation/art and logic
	- better looking/working menu screen
	- implement jumping and landing animation for character

you guys don't have to work on those right now, this is partially a mental note for me on where I left off
and partially just an FYI on what I worked on. Obviously, look back the Technical Design Document for other 
stuff we need to get done.
