4/11 Meeting Notes:

prototype wave system earlier because it may take more time than we think and it is a core feature of our game.

Think about saving and load. I actually think this is important, like if the user closes the game on wave 10 it should start at wave 10 the next time they load the game.
Will need to save things like current level, current weapon, current health (if upgradable), current speed (if upgradable). We can do that with a simple
save.json file that we read when the game loads.

Need to think of a good looking menu screen (not start menu but the menu in between rounds).

We will have to schedule a meeting in about 2 weeks and we should have a demo ready to show.
