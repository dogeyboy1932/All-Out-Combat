When player is moving and shooting the player glitches to the left for some reason.

When the player has not upgraded their speed at all, it is extremely difficult to dodge the shooter guy. So I upped the default player speed.

Also the shooting enemy should be animated I think.

The Among us character does not always move around, I think he gets clipped on the map but I am not sure.
