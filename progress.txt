TODO:
	- Fix player glitching while shooting
	- Update either UI or map/character design 
	- Spawner should spawn both types of enemies during level 2 and all types of enemies during level 3 (randomly selected which to spawn)
	- Timer should pause when player dies
	- Add an enemies remaining UI component and check that all enemies are dead before moving on to next level.
	- Readjust coins UI so that it is in bottom left of screen
	- (If we have time for this) If player dies during level their then remove the coins they gained from that level, basically reset their coins to before they started this level
