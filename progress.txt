TODO:
	- Update either UI or map/character design 
	- adjust rotation of bullet on fire
	- fix fire fire rate of gun to make it more difficult
	- remove weapon upgradable
	- change start game to start level
	- add sound effect on bullet fired and/or on bullet hit
	- (If we have time for this) If player dies during level their then remove the coins they gained from that level, basically reset their coins to before they started this level

DONE:
	- Fix player glitching while shooting
	- Spawner should spawn both types of enemies during level 2 and all types of enemies during level 3 (randomly selected which to spawn)
	- Timer should pause when player dies
	- Readjust coins UI so that it is in bottom left of screen
	- make timer 3 minutes so that gameplay is longer than 8 minuts total
